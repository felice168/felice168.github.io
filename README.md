### PROJECT

[Project 1](https://felice168.github.io/cit281-p1/) --- Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create a number of folders, List the folders in a tree-like structure, Use the ping command, and practice using the break keyboard sequence, Create and execute a JavaScript files using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug

[Project 2](https://felice168.github.io/cit281-p2/) --- Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo), Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring, Use git via VSCode
to create and use a .gitignore file & diff split screen

[Project 3](https://felice168.github.io/cit281-p3/) --- Creating a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality, then update the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file will display an initial web page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.

[Project 4](https://felice168.github.io/cit281-p4/) --- Creating a REST API that works with a "data" source of questions and answers. I will create all of the code to work with the data source using a code module, and test the code module code using provided testing code. I will also create a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb. 

[Project 5](https://felice168.github.io/cit281-p5/) --- Creating a Monster Game program using classes. The game will create monsters with initial life values, and minimum life values for the monster to be alive. Once the game is running, each monster's life will be drained by a random amount, and the game will continue until all of the monsters have died. The game will include a delay before each life drain.

[Project 6](https://felice168.github.io/cit281-p6/) --- Creating three classes. The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. A class that inherits from another class can be called the child class of the base, or parent, class. The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class. The base Shape class will provide the common functionality of a method that returns the perimeter value. Each of the other two classes will provide their own versions of a method that returns the area value. 

[Project 7](https://felice168.github.io/cit281-p7/) --- Creating an initial version of my CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages
